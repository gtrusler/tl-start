 âœ“ Starting...
 âš  The "experimental.esmExternals" option has been modified. experimental.esmExternals is not recommended to be modified as it may disrupt module resolution. It should be removed from your next.config.ts.
 âœ“ Ready in 852ms
 â¨¯ You are using configuration and/or tools that are not yet
supported by Next.js with Turbopack:


- Unsupported Next.js configuration option(s) (next.config.js)
  To use Turbopack, remove the following configuration options:
    - experimental.esmExternals


If you cannot make the changes above, but still want to try out
Next.js with Turbopack, create the Next.js playground app
by running the following commands:

  npx create-next-app --example with-turbopack with-turbopack-app
  cd with-turbopack-app
  npm run dev
